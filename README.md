<h1>Behaviour of species</h1>

<h2> Tigers </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Tigers only hunt during the day</li>
  <li> Tigers only hunt Zebras</li>
  <li>If a Tiger reaches an age of more than 150, they will die of old age</li>
  <li>Tigers will breed with the opposite gender and a valid breeding age(15)</li>
 <li>Tigers can pass on diseases to other Tigers as well as Lions at any time</li>
  <li>If a tiger does carry a disease, they have a 50% chance of dying at each step </li>
  </ul>



<h2> Lions</h2>
<ul>
 <li> Lions hunt Zebras and Mice </li>
 <li> Lions can hunt during the day and night </li>
   <li> Lions hunt Zebras and Mice </li>
 <li> Lions can hunt during the day and night </li>
   <li>  Lions will breed with other lions that are of the opposite gender and valid breeding 
age(15) </li>
 <li>  If a Lion exceeds the age of 150, they will die </li>
   <li>  Lions can pass on disease to other lions at any time, as well as Tigers </li>
 <li>  If a Lion does carry a disease, they have a 50% chance of dying at each step </li>

</ul>



<h2> Zebras</h2>
<ul>
   <li>  Zebras are awake and active during the day </li>
   <li>  If a Zebra exceeds the age of 150, they will die </li>
   <li>  They look for at eat grass </li>
   <li>  If their hunger level goes below zero, they will die </li>
   <li>  Depending on the age of the grass, zebras will get different food level gains when eating grass of different ages</li>
   <li>  Zebras can breed with other Zebras of opposite gender and once they reach their breeding age (5) </li>
   

</ul>



<h2> Hares</h2>
<ul>
 <li> Hares also eat grass and compete with Zebras in order to eat grass </li>
 <li>  If Hares exceed the age of 40, they will die </li>
 <li>  Hares are awake and active during the day </li>
 <li>  If their hunger level goes below zero, they will die</li>
 <li> Depending on the age of the grass, Hares will get different food level gains when eating grass of different ages </li>  
 <li>  Hares can breed with other Hares of opposite gender and at the breeding age(5)</li>
</ul>



<h2> Mice</h2>
<ul>
 <li> Majority of the time Mice will be looking for food or breeding </li>
 <li> Lions hunt mice </li>
 <li> They look for and eat grass </li>
 <li> If their hunger level goes below zero, they will die</li>
 <li>  Mice breed with other mice of opposite gender and of breeding age (5) </li>  
 <li> If the Mice reach over the age of 30, they will die</li>
</ul>


<h2>Grass</h2>
<ul>
 <li> Grass randomly spawns in any area </li>
 <li> Grass can breed with other grass, to create more grass at the breeding age of 5 </li>
 <li>  They will die due to reaching a maximum age(200) </li>
 <li> They can also die from overcrowding</li>
 <li>  If the weather is rainy there is a chance of more grass growing </li>  
 <li> Different ages of grass provide different food levels when consumed.</p></li>
</ul>
